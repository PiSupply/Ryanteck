The latest version of this anyio package can always be obtained from:

https://github.com/whaleygeek/anyio


The file referred to in the notes below is not included in RTK.GPIO, but 
the note is left for reference purposes.

The ProMicro.inf in the anyio/arduino/firmware folder originally came from
the sparkfun github repository, and is included here for convenience
only. The latest version was available from here:

https://github.com/sparkfun/SF32u4_boards/blob/master/driver/ProMicro.inf

However this is no longer available, see here:

https://github.com/sparkfun/SF32u4_boards

The referenced Arduino Boards repository also no longer includes the file.
